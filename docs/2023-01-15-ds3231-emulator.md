# DS3231 RTC Emulator

I’m very attached to the DS3231 temperature-compensated crystal oscillator (TCXO) real-time clock (RTC), particularly the low-cost modules available on Amazon.  I’ve been able to trim them with GPS to better than 0.1 ppm (at least short-term; that’s 3 seconds a year), and I’ve used them in lots of clock builds.

But it’s not the ultimate in clock technology.  I already have GPS-derived clocks which are essentially oracle-accurate.  I also recently got an Oven-Controlled Crystal Oscillator component (OCXO), the [ABRACON-AOCJYR](https://abracon.com/Precisiontiming/AOCJYR-10.000MHz-M5625LF.pdf).

### TCXO vs OCXO
The primary cause of crystal oscillator drift is a variation with temperature: In a TCXO such as ‘3231, the crystal temperature is regularly measured, and the circuit changes to compensate for the changes (e.g., by switching in and out small loading capacitors).

An OCXO takes a different approach: The crystal is held at a constant temperature with a small heating element and a thermostat.  Of course, this is far more power-hungry (since we’re constantly maintaining the crystal at some elevated temperature, and indeed relying on thermal loss to the environment in order to be able to control it) but it almost completely removes the influence of ambient temperature variation.  My OCXO claims a short-term stability of < 2 ppb per day (0.002 ppm).

However, whereas the DS3231 is a lovely integrated device that sits on the I2C bus and will report the current date and time when requested, the OCXO is just a crystal pumping out rock-steady 10 MHz oscillations.  It needs additional wrapping to turn it into a clock service.  (It’s also not a good candidate for battery-backup owing to the steady ~0.4W power consumption, compared to 0.4 mW when the DS3231 is on battery).

### Emulating a DS3231 with an OCXO
Given my existing builds that use a plug-in DS3231 module, I thought it would be nice to build a wrapper around the OCXO that looks from the outside just like a DS3231, for both reading and setting the time, and even for generating the 1 Hz output (which I use for precise synchronization in some systems), and why not the alarms also?  Hence, I embarked on a coding project to emulate the DS3231 using Arduino code.

From the point of view of the I2C interface, the DS3231 is simply an array of 19 bytes:

So the basic functionality is to set up an Arduino to allow reads (and writes) to a small array of bytes over I2C.  The Wire library we use to access I2C devices from the Arduino (i.e., I2C master mode) also supports acting as a  delegate, and provides two interrupt handler hooks to respond to bytes being sent to the delegate, and bytes being requested from the delegate.

### Arduino Wire.h and variable-length Requests
I2C is a low-level protocol that deals primarily with arbitrating between multiple delegates on the same bus.  Each transaction is initiated by the master and starts by sending the address of the specific delegate to be used.  Then, the master either sends one or more bytes, or receives one or more bytes, based on a read/write bit after the address.  After one device sends a byte, there is an ACK bit which the receiving device asserts to indicate the byte has been correctly received.  

The Arduino Wire API includes a signature **Wire.requestFrom(address, quantity)** which will receive a fixed number of bytes from a delegate.  But there’s no standard way in the protocol for the master to tell the delegate ahead of time how many bytes to return.  In many cases, it may be a fixed property of the delegate.  But with the DS3231 registers, the master could be reading just one, or all 19.  

Best I can tell, the way the DS3231 services a read is to keep returning bytes until the master fails to ACK one of them, whereupon it stops.  This is handled at a low level in the Wire code, so it can’t be exposed to the caller.  Instead, we just attempt to send all registers from the starting index to the end every time the master requests bytes.  Hopefully, the Wire library abandons the transmission after a NACK (best I can tell looking around line 436 of twi.c, this is right).

Here’s the code for the DS3231 emulator:

In addition to handing reading and writing of the registers over I2C, it also provides clock functions such as advancing the clock every second, and implementing the alarms and also the 1 PPS SQWV output (on the D3 pin).  However, the master timing is derived from the Arduino millis() counter rather than, e.g., an OCXO.  The 10 MHz is a bit tricky to handle on an ATMEL Arduino, so I’ll wait to move it onto a faster device.
